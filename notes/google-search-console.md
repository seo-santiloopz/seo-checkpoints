1. Add new domain name
1. Add the `TXT` value to your `TXT` property in `DNS configuration`. Give it a long `TTL` as this is a fixed value that can be statically cached.
1. Propagation of the new DNS config accross the network can probably take a while, maybe good moment to add an event in your calendar and get back here in a couple of days.
