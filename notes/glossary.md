### TTL / Time to live
`Time to live (TTL)` or `hop limit` is a mechanism that limits the lifespan or lifetime of data in a computer or network. `TTL` may be implemented as a counter or timestamp attached to or embedded in the data. Once the prescribed event count or timespan has elapsed, data is discarded or revalidated.
